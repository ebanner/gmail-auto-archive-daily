Archive inbox every day

## Summary

I'm experimenting with auto-archiving my email inbox every day. I think it will give me the feeling of a "fresh start" each day.

I'll probably check the archive first thing in the morning too, just to see if I missed anything.

## Notes

You don't have to deploy the Google Apps Script, you just have to save it.
